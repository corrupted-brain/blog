I'm a passionate cybersecurity professional with over 5 years of experience in protecting organizations from cyber threats. My expertise spans across penetration testing, vulnerability assessments, and security architecture design.

I believe in continuous learning and staying ahead of the evolving threat landscape. When I'm not securing systems, you'll find me researching the latest security trends, contributing to open-source security tools, or sharing knowledge through speaking engagements.

My mission is to make the digital world safer, one system at a time.
