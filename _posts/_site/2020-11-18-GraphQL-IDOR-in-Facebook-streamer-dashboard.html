<h4 id="description">Description:</h4>
<p>While viewing our stream dashboard data from creator studio, there is an endpoint from where we can see our dashboard status. There is parameter called <em>profile_id</em> in GraphQl request which can be misused to access data of other pages by using facebook page_id.</p>

<h4 id="steps-to-reproduce">Steps to Reproduce:</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Start burpsuite and intercept the request.</li>
  <li>Go to https://www.facebook.com/gaming/streamer and you will be redirected to creator studio.</li>
  <li>We will forward all the intercepted request since it’s difficult to spot the correct request which has vulnerable parameters in multiple requests.</li>
  <li>Meanwhile we will use find feature in burpsuite. we’ll search for <em>“GamesVideoStreamerDashboardProfileQuery”.</em>

  <li>Once our search query matches we will forward that particular request to repeator and replace <em>profileID</em> with desired game steaming pageID to see their stream stats. The response of the above request looks like as shown below.

According to facebook only highlighted information i.e. <em>“l30_live_earnings”</em> and <em>“supporter_count”</em> are sensitive which should not be disclosed to a user which does not have any role in the page.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion:</h4>
<p>After reviewing this issue, Facebook decided to award a bounty of $2000 and they fixed the issue by not displaying those information in the response to a users which does not have any role in page.
